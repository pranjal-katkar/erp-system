# Problem Statement

The current business workflows related to HR, inventory, procurement, finance tracking, and role-based access are handled through disconnected tools and manual processes. This leads to data duplication, lack of accuracy, limited visibility, delays in approvals, and difficulty in generating reports.

An integrated ERP Mini-System is required to centralize critical operational data, automate repetitive tasks, enforce data integrity, and provide structured access control.
